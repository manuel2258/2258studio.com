        <h4>How the EspDrone works: </h4>
        The drones main part is already written and does in theory work. The drone and the remote communicate using the
        default tcp/ip stack, while being connected over the ESP32 specific LongRange WiFi. That should theoretically
        give us a communication range of over 1km. Although in praxis it will be shorter, its should still be sufficient
        for our needs.
        <h5>Communication: </h5>
        As you probably can guess the communication is based on packages. Those will automatically be parsed into
        classes based on its first byte. There are currently several packages that are planned to be used, but it
        is easy to add new ones. The InputPackage is meant to be received regularly, like for example every 50ms.
        The rest are to only be sent when needed, as they rather represent options. For example is the user changes a
        rotation shift then the packages has to be sent from the remote controller to the drone.

        Some theoretically additions could for example be a video stream from the drone to the remote controller or more
        options.
        <h5>Processing: </h5>
        The packages aren't good for anything if their aren't processed. Of course the main goal is that each input
        package produces an Output that can be applied to the motors. For that the drone uses a dynamic event system
        that can easily be extended. Therefor each package will be converted into a Event and every EventReceiver will
        be notified that a new event is available. Each EventReceiver can then again add another event based on the
        received Event. For example the InputWatchdog. It makes sure that the communication is working correctly be
        expecting a InputPackage every 100ms. If non is received in that time it will produce another Event that then
        will result in the Drone shutting down its Motors.
        <h5>Pipeline: </h5>
        Another central EventReceiver is the Pipeline. Its job is to convert incoming InputPackages into an Motor
        Output. That is again done rather dynamically. The Pipeline has several Processors that modify the input
        package, convert the input into an motor output and then modify the motor output as well. Those Processors can
        again be EventReceivers. So a rather minimal pipeline for example could be
        Pipeline->InputShifter->DefaultConverter->PipelineOutput. The InputShifter then would receive RotationShift
        Packages and Pipeline would receive InputPackages.
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        Although those systems were not yet tested in a real flight, I'm rather optimistic that it will work well.
        You can of course always have a look at the implementation on github!
