        <h4>Alright, so here is the plan: </h4>
        We are currently trying to program and build our own drone. Of course we are going to use some already working
        products. Those would be 4 Racing Drone Motors as well as 4 ESC for them. Additionally we do need power so a
        LiPo Battery will be used too. <br>
        But the rest will fully be done by us. Its heart will be a self programed flight controller based on, as the
        name would suggest, an ESP32 Chip. The remote controller will also be developed by us and communicate to the
        drone using LongRange-WiFi. <br>
        Additionally we will design a full custom body and 3D-print it.
