                <h4>A small device to control the playback of a Spotify player.</h4>
                The Espify based on the ESP32-WROOM32 module and developed using the ESP-IDF SDK and C++. It basically
                acts as an additional keyboard that directly communicates with the Spotify API to remotely modify and
                display the currently played track.
                <h4>Features:</h4>
                <li>Change and pause the currently played track</li>
                <li>Change the players volume</li>
                <li>Displays title, artist and image of currently player track</li>
                <li>100% OpenSource and easy to build</li>
            </p>
            <h2>How to build</h2>
            <p>
                Alright, so you want to build your own Espify? Great because I'm going to show you how you can do that!
                <br>
                If you encounter any problems or need help otherwise, just contact me or write a git Issue.
                <h3>Hardware:</h3>
                You will need a few components, I will simply link the ones I bought from Ebay, but you can just buy
                them where you prefer.

                        ~10€ (Others might work as well, however the 3D-Models where designed for Gaterons)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2 USB-Cables, 1 for flashing that can still be used afterwards and 1 as powersource
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Additionally will need things like a soldering iron, some cables and several M3 screws/nuts. Also some
                way of 3D-printing would be needed for the enclosure. If you are living in Germany and don't have a
                3D-Printer then I can print it and ship it to you.
                <h3>Software:</h3>
                Watch out, the following paragraph is written for Linux users, therefor it might be a bit different for
                Windows or Mac users, but it should still work.
                <h4>ESP-IDF Setup:</h4>
                First you will have to setup the ESP-IDF toolchain, as its developer already have a good guide on their
                page I will simply refer to them. Do step 1-4, afterwards you should have a working build system.
                <br>
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html">
                    Get Started ESP32
                </a>
                <br>
                Make sure that you have set the $IDF_PATH variable and executed the export.sh. On my machine that does
                look something like that:
                <pre><code>export IDF_PATH=~/SDKs/esp-idf/
. ~/SDKs/esp-idf/export.sh</code></pre>
                After which the following should work. The version might vary a bit of course.
                <pre><code>idf.py --version
ESP-IDF v4.2-dev-792-g6330b3345</code></pre>
                <h4>Project Setup:</h4>
                We will now clone the Espify's code onto your machine.
                <pre><code>cd ~/path/to/parent
git clone https://github.com/manuel2258/espify.git
cd espify</code></pre>
                The current folder should look something like this: <br>
                <code>3d  CMakeLists.txt  components  icons_src.svg  main  Makefile  partitions.csv  sdkconfig  spiffs_image</code><br>
                A quick rundown of the folders/files:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>main: Source code</li>
                    <li>components: External dependencies</li>
                    <li>sdkconfig: ESP configurations, can be changed with "idf.py menuconfig"</li>
                    <li>spiffs_image: To include images and fonts</li>
                    <li>3d: Contains all printable 3d-Models and their OpenScad source</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Spotify Authentication:</h5>
                In order to get access to the Spotify API we have to obtain some authentication keys. Therefor you will
                have to create a project on their website.
                <br>
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications">
                    Spotify Dashboard
                </a>
                <br>
                Click on "CREATE A CLIENT ID", then just write any name and description, toggle "I don't know" and press
                "NEXT". <br>
                Afterwards click on your new project and click on "EDIT SETTINGS". Find "Redirect URIs", paste in:
                <pre><code>https://2258studio.com/espify/auth_token</code></pre>
                Finally press "ADD". Click on "SAVE" and copy
                your Client ID which you will then have to paste into the form bellow. After clicking on the button you
                will be redirected to the Spotify website. Log in and click on authorize. Then you will be redirected
                onto my side again, paste there your client id + secret and it will automatically generate a config file
                for you, download it. Don't worry I wont steal the secret, but simply make a request to get the refresh
                token from spotify.
                <br><br>
                <form accept-charset="UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    action="https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize" method="GET">
                    <input type="text" name="client_id" placeholder="Client ID">
                    <input type="hidden" name="response_type" value="code" />
                    <input type="hidden" name="redirect_uri" value="https://2258studio.com/espify/auth_token" />
                    <input type="hidden" name="scope" value="user-modify-playback-state%20user-read-playback-state" />
                    <button class="actions fit" type="submit">Get Auth Token</button>
                </form>
                If you don't like that you have to paste the client's secret into my side you can also make the requests
                manually. How to do that is described on the spotify side. You can use the config_temp.h file paste in
                the required fields and then rename it to config.h.<br>
                The downloaded config.h has to be copied into the projects main folder, therefor afterwards the main
                folder should look something like this:<br>
                <code>CMakeLists.txt  component.mk  config.h  config_temp.h  Kconfig.projbuild  main.cpp  server_root_cert.pem  src</code><br>
                <h5>Create and flash Spiffs Image:</h5>
                Spiffs is a sort of internal file manager, that the Espify uses for images and fonts. We have to
                generate a images from the to include files and then flash it.<br>
                For that we have to use the spiffsgen.py tool which is located at
                $IDF_PATH/components/spiffs/spiffsgen.py, in which IDF_PATH of course is where the esp-idf sdk is
                installed. Simply go into the espify's root folder and execute the bellow command. <br>
                <pre><code>$IDF_PATH/components/spiffs/spiffsgen.py 0x20000 ./spiffs_image storage.bin</code></pre>
                That should generate a new file named storage.bin in the root folder. Now we only have to flash that
                file. For that we will use esptool.py. Of course the esp should be connected to your PC over USB for the
                following to work. Also make sure to replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with the needed port of your machine.
                <pre><code>esptool.py --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash 0x17e360 storage.bin</code></pre>
                <h5>Build and flash main-app:</h5>
                Alright now we have to compile and flash the project, but at first we will have to edit the previously
                downloaded config.h file to also store the wifi credentials. Simply open main/config.h and fill in your
                homes wifi ssid and password to which the espify should connect. Again those won't be shared in anyway
                but you can verify that for yourself. Afterwards config.h should look something like that:
                <pre><code>#define CLIENT_ID "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
#define CLIENT_SECRET "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
#define REFRESH_TOKEN "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
                    
// Fill in your homes wifi ssid (name) and password
#define WIFI_SSID "TP-LINK_2.4GHz_B1FADE"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"</code></pre>
                Great, we can now build the project, for that type
                <pre><code>idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor</code></pre>
                which will build, flash and afterwards attach the monitor so that we can verify that everything works.
                When the Espify starts it will initialize the not yet conntected hardware, then connect to the wifi and
                request an accesstoken from spotify.
                Here is the output that you are looking for:
                <pre><code>I (4798) HttpsRequester: Connected to: TP-LINK_2.4GHz_B1FADE
I (4822) wifi:AP's beacon interval = 102400 us, DTIM period = 1
I (6121) esp_netif_handlers: sta ip: 192.168.1.104, mask: 255.255.255.0, gw: 192.168.1.1
I (6122) HttpsRequester: got ip:192.168.1.104
I (6135) HttpsRequester: Connecting to: https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
I (6768) HttpsRequester: 442 bytes written
I (6816) HttpsRequester: connection closed
I (6817) HttpsRequester: Received 763 bytes
I (6825) HttpsRequester: Collecting callbacks
I (6827) HttpsRequester: Added new request to queue
I (6827) HttpsRequester: Added new request to queue
I (6831) SpotifyManager: Access token received successfully: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx</code></pre>
                If it outputs the line "Access token received successfully" then everything is working and you are good
                to continue. Also if you are currently listening to music over spotify, it should also already fetch the
                currently running track, for example in my case:
                <pre><code>I (7583) SpotifyManager: Updated local player, new Track: Eminence->Children of the Night</code></pre>
                <h3>Wiring:</h3>
                That part should be rather easy, the espify has a default pin layout, however it can be changed. To
                change the buttons pin change the macros in the main/main.cpp. They are in the lines 22-28 and should be
                self explaining. To change the display pins you will have to open the esp-configs using
                <code>idf.py menuconfig</code> and then navigate to <code>Component config->TFT Display</code>. There
                you can change all settings regarding the display. Also if your display is using another chip, it might
                just works as well. I don't recommend using another display resolution as you would then have to change
                the graphics objects. If you however want to do that, make sure to contact me so that I can explain the
                code and help you. <br>
                Still here is a small wiring schematic:
                <br><br>
                <img src="{% link assets/images/espify/schematic.png %}" alt="Espify"
                    style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 70%;" />
                <br>
                A few things to note here:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Make a big joint for 5V and GND.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mount the key switches before soldering.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My display can be driven with 3.3V and 5V, make sure yours work with 3.3V as well. You can also
                        connect the displays VCC to 5V.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Well how to assemble the case should be rather obvious, so I won't point that out here. I hope my
                explanation was clear enough, if not again please reach out to me.<br>
                Well anyways thank you for reading and have fun with your Espify!
            </p>
