			<h2>Espify</h2>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/espify_clean.JPG %}" alt="Espify" /></span>
				<h4>A small device to control the playback of a Spotify player.</h4>
				The Espify based on the ESP32-WROOM module and developed using the ESP-IDF SDK and C++. It basically
				acts as an additional keyboard that directly communicates with the Spotify API to remotely modify and
				display the currently played track.
				<h4>Features:</h4>
				<li>Change and pause the currently played track</li>
				<li>Change the players volume</li>
				<li>Displays title, artist and image of currently player track</li>
				<li>100% OpenSource and easy to build</li>

			<h2>Timed</h2>
			<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/timed.webp %}" alt="" /></span>
				<h4>A puzzle mobile Game</h4>
				Timed is a physic based puzzle Android Game which is written in C# using the Unity Engine. Using the
				time itself as its main attraction, the games goal is to create a path for objects to reach their goal.
				That is done by define events at the right point in time to active elements which then interact with
				said objects. Although the projects is dead, it still is in a finished state and fun to play, so check
				it out. It again is OpenSource although I don't think that every file is included so it might not be
				buildable.

			<h2>Lighthub</h2>
			<p><span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/lighthub.JPG %}" alt="" /></span>
				<h4>A time controlled bottlelamp</h4>
				The Lighthub is a socket, which illuminates a bottle places on it. Times at which it should be
				activated, as well as its color can be configured over an Android-App, which directly communicates with
				the lighthub. The bottle size is dynamic so you can place your favorite Gin or Whiskey bottle on it and
				have let it brighten your room. It's written in Micropython and is made from an ESP8266 as well as a
				simple LED-Ring. Again 100% OpenSource and easy to build.
